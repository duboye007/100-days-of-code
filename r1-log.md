### R1D1 
Started a NGO website for a close friend 

**Today's Progress:**
Added all neccessary external link to my index (bootstrap, googlefonts, font Awesome, bootstarp script)

**Thoughts:**
 turns out i'm really rusty on my html and css as i struggled to get things up and running, will need to go back to my bootstrap tutorials to refresh my memory
