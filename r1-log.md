## Log

### R1D1 
Started a NGO website for a close friend (project zainab)

**Today's Progress:**
Added all neccessary external link to my index (bootstrap, googlefonts, font Awesome, bootstarp script)

**Thoughts:**
 turns out i'm really rusty on my html and css as i struggled to get things up and running, will need to go back to my bootstrap tutorials to refresh my memory

### R1D2
Continued javascript course on Freecodecamp

**Today's Progress:**
currently up to 80% on javascript freecode camp course learnt arrays, functions, objects, JSON 

**Thoughts:**
started a bit slow, felt like i should be able to solve the task without using hints on some, then i rrealised i'm still learning and its okay if i dont get it right the first time plus i was getting it wrong cause of spelling errors. and lack of confidence in myself(doubting my own answers)
